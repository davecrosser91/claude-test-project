# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .bmad-ai-research/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .bmad-ai-research/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.bmad-ai-research/personas/analyst.md`, `.bmad-ai-research/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: .bmad-ai-research/utils/template-format.md ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: .bmad-ai-research/tasks/create-story.md ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMad-Method framework.

# AI Research Knowledge Base

## Overview

This knowledge base provides guidance for conducting rigorous AI/ML research using the BMAD research expansion pack. It covers best practices, common pitfalls, and research-specific workflows that differ from software development.

## Research vs. Software Development

### Key Differences

| Aspect               | Software Development           | AI Research                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**             | Working product                | Novel contribution to knowledge       |
| **Success Criteria** | Features work, users satisfied | Advance state-of-the-art, publishable |
| **Deliverable**      | Deployed software              | Published paper + open-sourced code   |
| **Iteration**        | Minimize failures              | Expect failures, learn from them      |
| **Validation**       | User testing, QA               | Peer review, reproducibility          |
| **Timeline**         | Predictable sprints            | Variable, experiment-dependent        |
| **Context**          | Business requirements          | Scientific literature                 |

### What This Means for BMAD Workflow

**Planning Phase:**

- PRD ‚Üí Research Proposal (problem, hypotheses, approach)
- Architecture ‚Üí Experimental Architecture (detailed methodology)
- Stories ‚Üí Experiment Specifications (individual experiments)

**Development Phase:**

- Dev implements experiments, not features
- QA checks reproducibility, not user requirements
- Iteration expected - experiments guide next steps

**Delivery:**

- Not software release, but paper submission

## Best Practices

### Literature Review

- Start broad, narrow down
- Use citation trails (papers cite other important papers)
- Look for survey papers for comprehensive overviews
- Organize by themes, not chronologically
- Identify specific gaps, not just "more research needed"
- Track key papers in detail

### Hypothesis Formation

- Be specific and testable
- Connect to research gap
- Predict quantitative outcomes when possible
- Example: "Method X will improve accuracy by 5-10% on dataset Y because Z"

### Experimental Design

- **One variable at a time**: Isolate contributions
- **Fair comparisons**: Same data, compute, eval protocol
- **Strong baselines**: Compare against best existing methods
- **Multiple runs**: 3-5 seeds minimum for statistical validity
- **Ablation studies**: Validate each component's contribution
- **Negative controls**: Experiments that should fail

### Implementation

- **Code quality matters**: Others will read and use it
- **Modular design**: Easy to swap components for ablations
- **Version control**: Git everything (code, configs, not models)
- **Reproducibility by design**: Set seeds, log everything
- **Start simple**: Simplest version first, add complexity incrementally
- **Unit tests**: Test key components

### Experimentation

- **Fail fast**: Quick experiments to validate assumptions
- **Monitor actively**: Don't launch and forget
- **Document immediately**: Notes while fresh in memory
- **Save everything**: Checkpoints, logs, configs
- **Multiple seeds**: Variance matters
- **Compute wisely**: Dry runs before full experiments

### Analysis

- **Look beyond metrics**: Understand what model learned
- **Statistical rigor**: Report mean ¬± std, significance tests
- **Honest reporting**: Include negative results
- **Error analysis**: Why did it fail on certain examples?
- **Visualization**: Figures often reveal insights numbers don't

### Writing

- **Contribution clarity**: Reader should know contributions in first page
- **Tell a story**: Motivate ‚Üí propose ‚Üí validate ‚Üí impact
- **Active voice**: "We propose" not "A method is proposed"
- **Be precise**: Technical accuracy crucial
- **Generous citations**: Give credit, position work fairly
- **Respect page limits**: Every word counts

## Common Pitfalls

### Research Design

- ‚ùå **Incremental work**: Too similar to existing methods
- ‚ùå **Weak baselines**: Only comparing against strawmen
- ‚ùå **Unclear contribution**: What specifically is novel?
- ‚ùå **Unfalsifiable claims**: Can't be disproven

### Experimental Execution

- ‚ùå **Data leakage**: Test information in training
- ‚ùå **Unfair comparisons**: Different hyperparameter tuning effort
- ‚ùå **Cherry-picking**: Reporting only favorable results
- ‚ùå **Single runs**: Not showing variance
- ‚ùå **Overfitting to test set**: Tuning on test performance

### Reproducibility

- ‚ùå **Missing seeds**: Can't reproduce exact results
- ‚ùå **Unpinned dependencies**: "Works on my machine"
- ‚ùå **Undocumented steps**: Manual preprocessing not documented
- ‚ùå **Private data**: Using data others can't access
- ‚ùå **Missing details**: Insufficient information to reproduce

### Writing

- ‚ùå **Overclaiming**: Exaggerating results or significance
- ‚ùå **Missing related work**: Not citing relevant papers
- ‚ùå **Unclear writing**: Unnecessarily complex language
- ‚ùå **No limitations**: Every method has limitations
- ‚ùå **Unreadable figures**: Too small, unclear labels

## Research Ethics

### Honest Reporting

- Report all experiments, not just successful ones
- Acknowledge limitations and failure modes
- Don't cherry-pick favorable results
- Be transparent about what worked and what didn't

### Fair Comparisons

- Give baselines same hyperparameter tuning effort
- Use same evaluation protocols
- Cite and implement baselines accurately
- Don't create strawman baselines to beat

### Reproducibility

- Release code and data when possible
- Document everything needed to reproduce
- Make reproducibility a priority, not afterthought
- Help others build on your work

### Attribution

- Cite related work fairly and generously
- Acknowledge prior art honestly
- Give credit to collaborators
- Don't claim others' contributions as your own

### Broader Impacts

- Consider potential misuse of technology
- Acknowledge societal implications
- Be honest about limitations and risks
- Many venues now require broader impact statements

## Statistical Best Practices

### Multiple Runs

- Run with at least 3-5 different random seeds
- Report mean and standard deviation
- Include variance in all comparisons
- Single runs hide true performance

### Significance Testing

- Use appropriate statistical tests (paired t-test common)
- Report p-values for main comparisons
- Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons
- Effect sizes matter, not just significance

### Confidence Intervals

- Report 95% confidence intervals when possible
- Helps assess practical significance
- Shows overlap between methods
- More informative than just p-values

### Fair Evaluation

- Same train/val/test splits for all methods
- Hyperparameter tuning on validation set only
- Never tune on test set
- Report metrics on multiple datasets when possible

## Publication Strategy

### Choosing Venues

**Top-tier ML conferences (accept ~20-25%):**

- NeurIPS (Neural Information Processing Systems)
- ICML (International Conference on Machine Learning)
- ICLR (International Conference on Learning Representations)

- CoRL, ICRA, RSS (robotics)
- And many others

**Strategy:**

- Target top venue first
- If rejected, incorporate feedback and try next venue
- Build reputation with solid, reproducible work
- Workshop papers good for preliminary ideas

### Timing

- Conferences have 1-2 deadlines per year
- Plan backward from deadline
- Allow time for internal review before submission
- Factor in rebuttal/revision periods

### Reviewer Perspective

Write for reviewers who will:

- Read many papers quickly
- Look for novelty and rigor

## Notes

**Before running experiment:**

- This checklist should be nearly 100% complete
- Any unchecked critical items should block execution
- Document reasons for any N/A items

**Common reasons experiments fail:**

- Random seeds not set ‚Üí non-reproducible
- Config not saved ‚Üí can't remember settings
- Insufficient logging ‚Üí can't diagnose issues
- No checkpointing ‚Üí lose everything if crashes
- Untested code ‚Üí runtime errors waste compute

**Time investment:**

- Spending 1-2 hours on this checklist saves days of wasted compute
- Reproducibility from day one easier than retrofitting
- Good habits compound across many experiments

**When in doubt:**

- Over-document rather than under-document
- Over-log rather than under-log
- Test more rather than less
- Ask collaborators to review before launching expensive runs
