## 🎯 What is BMAD-Core-GitHub?

**BMAD-Core-GitHub** is a complete AI-powered software development framework that orchestrates specialized AI agents through the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) using **GitHub as the backbone**.

### Key Features

✅ **GitHub-Native Task Management**

- Milestones = Epics
- Issues = User Stories
- Labels = Status tracking (backlog, todo, doing, review, done)
- Pull Requests = Implementation + Code Review

✅ **9 Specialized AI Agents**

- Analyst, PM, Architect, Developer, QA, Scrum Master, Product Owner, Dev Team Lead, UX Expert

✅ **Documents in Git**

- All docs as markdown in `docs/` folder
- Full Git version control
- PR-based document reviews

✅ **Automated QA**

- AI-powered code review on every PR
- Automatic status transitions
- Pass/Fail verdicts with detailed feedback

✅ **Parallel Execution**

- Wave-based parallel development
- 3-5x faster than sequential
- Dependency-aware orchestration

✅ **No External Dependencies**

- Just GitHub + Git + GitHub CLI
- Optional: Archon MCP for semantic search (user adds separately)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Account** with a repository
2. **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) installed and authenticated
3. **Git** installed

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone or navigate to your project
cd your-project

# 2. Install GitHub CLI (if not already installed)
# macOS:
brew install gh

# Linux:
sudo apt install gh

# Windows:
winget install GitHub.cli

# 3. Authenticate GitHub CLI
gh auth login

# 4. Initialize BMAD-GitHub in your project
# Copy the .bmad-github folder to your project root
cp -r /path/to/bmad-method/expansion-packs/bmad-core-github/.bmad-github .

# 5. Setup GitHub labels
.bmad-github/scripts/setup-labels.sh

# 6. Copy GitHub Actions workflows
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cp .bmad-github/workflows/*.yml .github/workflows/

# 7. Copy issue templates
mkdir -p .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE
cp .bmad-github/issue-templates/*.yml .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/

# 8. Create docs folder structure
mkdir -p docs/{prd,architecture,specs,guides,notes}

# 9. Git commit the setup
git add .
git commit -m "chore: Initialize BMAD-Core-GitHub v1.0"
git push
```

### ✨ Or Use the Setup Assistant (Recommended!)

We've created a dedicated **Setup Assistant agent** that guides you through the entire GitHub-specific setup with explanations:

```bash
# In Claude Code or your IDE
"Please act as the Setup Assistant from .bmad-core-github/agents/setup-assistant.md"

Alex: 👋 Hi! I'm Alex, your Setup Assistant.
      I'll guide you through the BMAD-Core-GitHub setup step by step!

# Run the complete setup wizard
"*setup"

# Or check what's already configured
"*check-status"

# Or verify everything is working
"*verify"
```

The Setup Assistant will:

- ✅ Check prerequisites (GitHub CLI, authentication, git repo)
- ✅ Guide you through label creation with explanations
- ✅ Help set up automated QA (optional)
- ✅ Create documentation folders
- ✅ Verify everything is configured correctly
- ✅ Explain why each step matters

**This is the easiest way to get started!**

## 🎓 Best Practices

### 1. Always Start with Planning

```
Analyst → PM → Architect → Dev
```

Don't skip ahead! Each phase builds on the previous one.

### 2. Mark Dependencies Clearly

```markdown
## Dependencies

Depends on: #101, #102
```

This enables parallel execution and prevents blocked work.

### 3. Use Size Estimates

Label stories with size (xs/s/m/l/xl) for better sprint planning.

### 4. One Story in "doing" at a Time

Focus on completing stories, not starting many.

### 5. Trust Automated QA, But Verify

Automated QA catches most issues, but manual review is available for edge cases.

### 6. Commit Documents Frequently

All docs in Git = full version history.

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### File: `.bmad-github/config.yaml`

```yaml
github:
  tasks:
    use_milestones_for_epics: true
    use_labels_for_status: true

    status_flow:
      - backlog
      - todo
      - doing
      - review
      - done

    auto_link_pr_to_issue: true
    auto_close_on_merge: true

  projects:
    use_projects_v2: true
    default_view: 'board'

documents:

  structure:
    prd: 'docs/prd/'
    architecture: 'docs/architecture/'
    specs: 'docs/specs/'
    guides: 'docs/guides/'
    notes: 'docs/notes/'

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Typical Speedup by Project Size

| Project Size | Tasks | Sequential | Parallel | Speedup |
| ------------ | ----- | ---------- | -------- | ------- |
| Small        | 5-10  | 10-20hr    | 4-6hr    | 2.5x    |
| Medium       | 10-30 | 20-60hr    | 8-15hr   | 3.5x    |
| Large        | 30+   | 60-120hr   | 15-30hr  | 4.5x    |

### Wave-Based Parallel Execution

```
Traditional (Sequential):     Parallel (Wave-Based):
Dev → Task 1 (2hr)           Wave 1: 5 devs × 2hr = 2hr
Dev → Task 2 (2hr)           Wave 2: 5 devs × 2hr = 2hr
Dev → Task 3 (2hr)           Wave 3: 5 devs × 2hr = 2hr
...
20 tasks = 40 hours          20 tasks = 6 hours

                             Speedup: 6.7x
```

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: GitHub CLI not authenticated

```bash
gh auth status
# If not authenticated:
gh auth login
```

### Issue: Labels not created

```bash
# Run setup script manually
.bmad-github/scripts/setup-labels.sh
```

### Issue: Automated QA not running

Check:

1. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret is set
2. Workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`
3. Workflow has correct permissions

### Issue: Circular dependencies

```
❌ ERROR: Circular dependency detected
Remaining tasks: #201, #202
```

**Fix:** Review with Architect, remove circular references.

### Issue: PR not auto-updating issue status

Check that PR body contains `Fixes #123` or `Closes #123`.

## 🔄 Workflow Comparison

### vs. Archon Version

| Feature         | BMAD-Core-Archon | BMAD-Core-GitHub                  |
| --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Task Management | Archon MCP       | GitHub Issues                     |
| Semantic Search | ✅ RAG           | ❌ Keyword only                   |
| Version Control | Snapshots        | Git (more powerful)               |
| Pull Requests   | ❌ No            | ✅ Full PR workflow               |
| CI/CD           | ❌ No            | ✅ GitHub Actions                 |
| Learning Curve  | New tool         | Familiar to devs                  |
| Cost            | Open source      | Free (public) / $4/user (private) |

**Choose GitHub when:**

- Team already uses GitHub
- Want familiar tools
- Need PR workflows
- Want CI/CD integration

**Choose Archon when:**

- Need semantic search
- Self-hosting preferred
- No rate limits needed
