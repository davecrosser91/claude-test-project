## \*setup - Complete Setup Wizard

Let me guide you through the complete setup process step by step!

### Step 1: Check Prerequisites

First, let me check what we need to set up:

1. **Check if GitHub CLI is installed:**

   ```bash
   gh --version
   ```

   **Expected output:** `gh version 2.x.x`

   **If not installed:**
   - **macOS:** `brew install gh`
   - **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
     ```bash
     curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
     echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install gh
     ```
   - **Windows:** `winget install GitHub.cli`

2. **Check if authenticated with GitHub:**

   ```bash
   gh auth status
   ```

   **Expected output:** `✓ Logged in to github.com`

   **If not authenticated:**

   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```

   Follow the prompts:
   - Choose "GitHub.com"
   - Choose "HTTPS"
   - Authenticate via browser

   **Why this matters:** GitHub CLI is how BMAD agents create issues, milestones, and manage your GitHub repository programmatically. Without authentication, the agents can't interact with GitHub.

3. **Check if we're in a Git repository:**

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

   **If not a Git repo:**

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

   **Why this matters:** BMAD-Core-GitHub uses GitHub Issues and Milestones for task management, so you need a GitHub repository.

4. **Check if GitHub remote is configured:**

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

   **If no remote configured:**

   ```bash
   # Option 1: Create new GitHub repo
   gh repo create your-project-name --public --source=. --remote=origin

   # Option 2: Link to existing repo
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

   **Why this matters:** The agents need to know which GitHub repository to work with.

### Step 2: Setup GitHub Labels

Now let's create the labels that BMAD uses for task management:

```bash
# Make the script executable (if not already)
chmod +x .bmad-core-github/expansion-packs/bmad-core-github/scripts/setup-labels.sh

# Run the setup script
.bmad-core-github/expansion-packs/bmad-core-github/scripts/setup-labels.sh
```

**What this creates:**

- **Status Labels** (5):
  - `status:backlog` (gray) - Not yet scheduled
  - `status:todo` (blue) - Ready to start
  - `status:doing` (yellow) - In progress
  - `status:review` (orange) - In PR review
  - `status:done` (green) - Completed

- **Type Labels** (4):
  - `type:epic` (purple) - Large feature
  - `type:story` (blue) - User story
  - `type:task` (light blue) - Development task
  - `type:bug` (red) - Bug fix

- **Priority Labels** (4):
  - `priority:p0` (red) - Critical
  - `priority:p1` (orange) - High
  - `priority:p2` (yellow) - Medium
  - `priority:p3` (gray) - Low

- **Size Labels** (5):
  - `size:xs` - Extra small (< 1 hour)
  - `size:s` - Small (1-4 hours)
  - `size:m` - Medium (1 day)
  - `size:l` - Large (2-3 days)
  - `size:xl` - Extra large (> 3 days)

**Why this matters:** These labels are how BMAD tracks the status of issues (tasks) through your development workflow. The PM, Dev, and SM agents will use these labels to organize and move tasks through the workflow.

**Verify labels were created:**

```bash
gh label list
```

You should see all 18 labels listed.

### Step 3: Create Documentation Folders

Create the folder structure for your project documentation:

```bash
mkdir -p docs/{prd,architecture,specs,guides,notes}
```

**What each folder is for:**

- `docs/prd/` - Product Requirements Documents (created by PM agent)
- `docs/architecture/` - Architecture designs, ADRs, tech stack (created by Architect agent)
- `docs/specs/` - Detailed specifications and designs
- `docs/guides/` - User guides, developer guides
- `docs/notes/` - Project briefs, meeting notes, brainstorming (created by Analyst agent)

**Why this matters:** BMAD agents create markdown documents in these folders. The PM creates PRDs, the Architect creates architecture docs, etc. These documents are version-controlled in Git.

### Step 4: Setup GitHub Actions (Optional - Recommended)

GitHub Actions enable **automated QA** - an AI reviewer that automatically reviews every pull request.

**Do you want automated QA?** (Recommended: Yes)

If yes, let's set it up:

1. **Get Anthropic API Key:**
   - Go to https://console.anthropic.com/
   - Sign up or log in
   - Navigate to "API Keys"
   - Click "Create Key"
   - Copy the key (starts with `sk-ant-...`)

   **Why this is needed:** The automated QA agent uses Claude Sonnet 4 to review your code for quality, bugs, and best practices.

2. **Add API key to GitHub Secrets:**

   ```bash
   gh secret set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   # Paste your API key when prompted
   ```

   **Verify secret was set:**

   ```bash
   gh secret list
   # Should show: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   ```

3. **Copy GitHub Actions workflow:**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   cp .bmad-core-github/expansion-packs/bmad-core-github/workflows/automated-qa-review.yml .github/workflows/
   ```

   **What this does:** When you create a pull request, GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Run the automated QA agent
   - Review your code using Claude Sonnet 4
   - Post a review verdict: PASS, FAIL_MINOR, or FAIL_MAJOR
   - Update the issue status based on the verdict

4. **Commit and push:**

   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/automated-qa-review.yml
   git commit -m "chore: Add BMAD automated QA workflow"
   git push
   ```

**If you skip this step:** You can still use manual QA with the QA agent. Automated QA is a nice-to-have that saves time.

### Step 5: Setup Claude Code GitHub Integration (Optional - Powerful!)

Do you want to trigger Claude directly from GitHub issues and PRs by mentioning `@claude`?

**Benefits:**

- Work with Claude directly from GitHub (no IDE needed)
- Perfect for remote collaboration
- Quick fixes from mobile or web
- Team members can request Claude's help on issues

If yes:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cp .bmad-core-github/expansion-packs/bmad-core-github/workflows/claude-code-integration.yml .github/workflows/
```

**Configure permissions** (important):

1. Run: `gh repo view --web`
2. Go to **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**
3. Select: **Read and write permissions**
4. Check: **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**
5. Click **Save**

**Test it:**

```bash
gh issue create --title "Test: @claude integration" --body "@claude Say hello!"
# Check Actions tab to see Claude respond
```

For complete setup guide, run: `*setup-claude-integration`

**If you skip this step:** You can still use BMAD agents from your IDE (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.). This integration is for triggering Claude from GitHub itself.

### Step 6: Setup Issue Templates (Optional)

Issue templates make it easier to create well-formatted epics and user stories in GitHub.

**Do you want issue templates?** (Recommended: Yes for teams)

If yes:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE
cp .bmad-core-github/expansion-packs/bmad-core-github/templates/issue-templates/*.yml .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
```

**What this provides:**

- Epic template
- User Story template
- Bug Report template

**Why this helps:** When team members manually create issues in GitHub (outside of BMAD), these templates ensure consistent formatting.

**Commit and push:**

```bash
git add .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
git commit -m "chore: Add BMAD issue templates"
git push
```

### Step 6: Commit Initial Setup

Let's commit all the setup to Git:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: Complete BMAD-Core-GitHub setup

- Initialized docs folder structure
- Added GitHub labels for task management
- Configured GitHub Actions for automated QA
- Added issue templates

Setup completed with BMAD Setup Assistant"

git push
```

### Step 7: Verification

Let me verify everything is set up correctly:

```bash
# 1. Check GitHub CLI authentication
echo "Checking GitHub CLI authentication..."
gh auth status

# 2. Check labels
echo -e "\nChecking GitHub labels..."
gh label list | grep "status:\|type:\|priority:\|size:" | wc -l
# Should show 18

# 3. Check docs folder
echo -e "\nChecking docs folder structure..."
ls -la docs/

# 4. Check GitHub Actions (if installed)
echo -e "\nChecking GitHub Actions..."
ls -la .github/workflows/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No workflows installed (optional)"

# 5. Check secrets (if automated QA enabled)
echo -e "\nChecking GitHub secrets..."
gh secret list 2>/dev/null || echo "No secrets configured (only needed for automated QA)"
```

**Expected results:**

- ✅ GitHub CLI: Logged in
- ✅ Labels: 18 labels found
- ✅ Docs folder: 5 subdirectories (prd, architecture, specs, guides, notes)
- ✅ GitHub Actions: (optional) automated-qa-review.yml found
- ✅ Secrets: (optional) ANTHROPIC_API_KEY found

## \*setup-gh-cli - GitHub CLI Setup Guide

Let me help you install and configure GitHub CLI:

### Check if GitHub CLI is installed

```bash
gh --version
```

### If not installed:

**macOS:**

```bash
brew install gh
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh
```

**Windows:**

```bash
winget install GitHub.cli
```

### Authenticate with GitHub

```bash
gh auth login
```

**Follow the prompts:**

1. Choose "GitHub.com"
2. Choose "HTTPS"
3. Choose "Login with a web browser"
4. Copy the one-time code shown
5. Press Enter to open browser
6. Paste the code and authorize

**Verify authentication:**

```bash
gh auth status
# Should show: ✓ Logged in to github.com
```

**What GitHub CLI is used for:**

- Creating GitHub Issues (user stories/tasks)
- Creating Milestones (epics)
- Managing labels and status
- Creating and managing pull requests
- Reading and updating task status

All BMAD agents (PM, Dev, SM, QA) use GitHub CLI to interact with your repository.

---

## \*setup-labels - GitHub Labels Setup

Let me guide you through creating the GitHub labels:

### Run the setup script

```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x .bmad-core-github/expansion-packs/bmad-core-github/scripts/setup-labels.sh

# Run the script
.bmad-core-github/expansion-packs/bmad-core-github/scripts/setup-labels.sh
```

### What gets created

The script creates 18 labels in 4 categories:

**Status Labels (workflow stages):**

- `status:backlog` - Task not yet scheduled for current sprint
- `status:todo` - Ready to start, all dependencies met
- `status:doing` - Currently in development
- `status:review` - In PR review / QA testing
- `status:done` - Completed, merged, closed

**Type Labels (task types):**

- `type:epic` - Large feature (uses Milestones)
- `type:story` - User story
- `type:task` - Development task
- `type:bug` - Bug fix

**Priority Labels:**

- `priority:p0` - Critical (drop everything)
- `priority:p1` - High (this sprint)
- `priority:p2` - Medium (next sprint)
- `priority:p3` - Low (backlog)

**Size Labels (estimation):**

- `size:xs` - Extra small (< 1 hour)
- `size:s` - Small (1-4 hours)
- `size:m` - Medium (1 day)
- `size:l` - Large (2-3 days)
- `size:xl` - Extra large (> 3 days)

### Verify labels

```bash
gh label list
```

### How labels are used

- **PM Agent**: Creates stories with type:story, status:backlog, and assigns priority/size
- **SM Agent**: Moves tasks from backlog → todo during sprint planning
- **Dev Agent**: Updates status to doing when starting work, creates PR linking to issue
- **QA Agent**: Changes status to review when PR is opened, back to doing/todo if issues found
- **Automated**: When PR is merged, status automatically changes to done

**The labels enable the complete SDLC workflow in GitHub!**

---

## \*setup-actions - GitHub Actions Setup

Let me help you set up automated QA with GitHub Actions:

### Step 1: Get Anthropic API Key

1. Visit: https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Sign up or log in
3. Click "API Keys" in the sidebar
4. Click "Create Key"
5. Give it a name like "BMAD QA Agent"
6. Copy the key (starts with `sk-ant-...`)

**Keep this key safe!** You'll need it in the next step.

### Step 2: Add API Key to GitHub Secrets

```bash
gh secret set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
# Paste your API key when prompted
```

**Verify the secret:**

```bash
gh secret list
# Should show: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

**Why secrets?** The API key needs to be accessible to GitHub Actions but should never be committed to your repository for security.

### Step 3: Copy GitHub Actions Workflow

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cp .bmad-core-github/expansion-packs/bmad-core-github/workflows/automated-qa-review.yml .github/workflows/
```

### Step 4: Commit and Push

```bash
git add .github/workflows/automated-qa-review.yml
git commit -m "chore: Add BMAD automated QA workflow"
git push
```

### How Automated QA Works

When you create a pull request:

1. **GitHub Actions triggers** the automated-qa-review workflow
2. **QA Agent analyzes** the code changes using Claude Sonnet 4
3. **Reviews for**:
   - Code quality and best practices
   - Potential bugs or issues
   - Test coverage
   - Code complexity
   - Security concerns
4. **Posts verdict**:
   - `PASS` - Code looks good, ready to merge
   - `FAIL_MINOR` - Minor issues, send back to doing for quick fixes
   - `FAIL_MAJOR` - Major issues, send back to todo for rework
5. **Updates issue status** automatically based on verdict

**Cost:** Approximately $0.01-0.05 per PR review (Claude Sonnet 4 pricing)

**You can still do manual QA** by using the QA agent directly if you prefer not to use automated QA.

## \*setup-claude-integration - Claude Code GitHub Integration

Let me help you set up Claude Code integration with GitHub so you can trigger Claude directly from issues and PRs!

### What This Enables

With Claude Code GitHub integration, you can:

- **Comment `@claude` on issues** to have Claude help implement the feature
- **Comment `@claude` on PRs** to have Claude review or fix code
- **Trigger BMAD agents** directly from GitHub without leaving your browser

This is perfect for:

- Remote team collaboration
- Working from GitHub mobile
- Quick fixes without opening your IDE
- Getting Claude's help on specific issues

### Prerequisites

You should have already completed:

- ✅ `*setup-actions` (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY secret configured)

If not, run `*setup-actions` first.

### Step 1: Copy Claude Code Integration Workflow

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cp .bmad-core-github/expansion-packs/bmad-core-github/workflows/claude-code-integration.yml .github/workflows/
```

**What this workflow does:**

- Listens for comments on issues and PRs
- Triggers when you mention `@claude` in a comment
- Runs Claude Code with access to your repository
- Posts responses back as comments
- Can commit changes if instructed

### Step 2: Configure Permissions (Important!)

The workflow needs specific permissions. Let's check your repository settings:

```bash
# Open repository settings in browser
gh repo view --web
```

Then navigate to:

1. **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**
2. Scroll to **Workflow permissions**
3. Select: **Read and write permissions**
4. Check: **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**
5. Click **Save**

**Why this matters:** Without these permissions, Claude Code can't commit changes or create PRs on your behalf.

### Step 3: Optional - Configure Agent Selection

You can configure which BMAD agent Claude uses based on context.

Edit `.github/workflows/claude-code-integration.yml`:

```yaml
# Default: Claude chooses agent automatically
- name: Run Claude Code
  uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
  with:
    anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

# Or: Specify a specific agent
- name: Run Claude Code
  uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
  with:
    anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    agent-file: .bmad-core-github/agents/dev.md # Always use Dev agent
```

**Agent Selection Strategies:**

**Option 1: Auto-select (Recommended)**

```yaml
# Let Claude choose based on context
# - Issues labeled "type:bug" → QA agent
# - Issues labeled "type:story" → Dev agent
# - PR reviews → QA agent
```

**Option 2: Fixed agent per workflow**

```yaml
# Create multiple workflows for different contexts
# claude-code-dev.yml → uses dev.md
# claude-code-qa.yml → uses qa.md
```

**Option 3: Label-based selection**

```yaml
# Use GitHub labels to specify agent
# Comment: "@claude" on issue with label "agent:dev" → Dev agent
# Comment: "@claude" on issue with label "agent:qa" → QA agent
```

### Step 4: Commit and Push

```bash
git add .github/workflows/claude-code-integration.yml
git commit -m "feat: Add Claude Code GitHub integration

Enables @claude mentions in issues and PRs to trigger Claude Code
directly from GitHub without opening IDE."
git push
```

### Step 5: Test the Integration

Let's create a test issue to verify it works:

```bash
# Create a test issue
gh issue create \
  --title "Test: Claude Code Integration" \
  --body "This is a test issue to verify Claude Code integration.

@claude Please confirm you can see this issue and respond with a greeting."
```

**Expected result:**

Within 1-2 minutes, you should see:

1. GitHub Actions workflow starts (check Actions tab)
2. Claude posts a comment on the issue confirming it works
3. Workflow completes successfully

**If it doesn't work:**

- Check Actions tab for error messages
- Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set: `gh secret list`
- Verify workflow permissions (Settings → Actions → General)
- Check workflow file syntax

### Usage Examples

Once set up, you can use Claude directly from GitHub:

**Example 1: Implement a feature**

```
Comment on issue #123:

@claude Please implement this user story following the acceptance criteria.
Use the Dev agent and create a PR when done.
```

**Example 2: Review a PR**

```
Comment on PR #45:

@claude Please review this PR using the QA agent.
Check for code quality, tests, and security issues.
```

**Example 3: Fix a bug**

```
Comment on issue #67 (labeled type:bug):

@claude This bug is causing login failures.
Please investigate and create a PR with a fix.
```

**Example 4: Update documentation**

```
Comment on issue #89:

@claude Please update the README to include installation instructions
for the new database setup.
```

### How It Works

1. **You comment** `@claude <your request>` on an issue or PR
2. **GitHub Actions triggers** the claude-code-integration workflow
3. **Claude Code runs** with context from the issue/PR and repository
4. **Claude responds** as a comment and/or creates commits/PRs
5. **Workflow completes** and you get notified

### Cost Considerations

Each `@claude` invocation costs approximately:

- **Simple query/response**: $0.01-0.05
- **Code implementation**: $0.10-0.50
- **Large refactoring**: $0.50-2.00

(Based on Claude Sonnet 4 pricing and typical prompt sizes)

**Tip:** Use specific instructions to minimize back-and-forth and reduce costs.

### Security Considerations

**What Claude can do:**

- ✅ Read your repository code
- ✅ Create commits on branches
- ✅ Create pull requests
- ✅ Comment on issues/PRs
- ✅ Update issue labels and status

**What Claude cannot do:**

- ❌ Merge PRs without approval (requires workflow approval settings)
- ❌ Delete branches or force push (unless explicitly configured)
- ❌ Access secrets beyond ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and GITHUB_TOKEN
- ❌ Modify GitHub repository settings

**Best practices:**

- Review all PRs created by Claude before merging
- Use branch protection rules on main/master
- Monitor Actions usage and costs
- Set up notifications for Claude-created PRs

### Limitations

- **Rate limits**: GitHub Actions has concurrent job limits
- **Timeout**: Workflows timeout after 6 hours (usually completes in minutes)
- **Context size**: Very large repositories may hit context limits
- **Branch restrictions**: Cannot push to protected branches without approval

### Disable Integration

To disable Claude Code integration:

```bash
# Remove the workflow file
rm .github/workflows/claude-code-integration.yml

Let me help you set up GitHub issue templates:

### Copy Templates

```bash
mkdir -p .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE
cp .bmad-core-github/expansion-packs/bmad-core-github/templates/issue-templates/*.yml .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
```

### What Gets Added

Three issue templates:

1. **Epic Template** (`epic.yml`)
   - For large features spanning multiple stories
   - Includes: Goals, Success Criteria, Stories list, Dependencies

2. **User Story Template** (`user-story.yml`)
   - For user-facing features
   - Includes: User story format, Acceptance Criteria, Tasks, Dependencies

3. **Bug Report Template** (`bug-report.yml`)
   - For reporting bugs
   - Includes: Description, Steps to Reproduce, Expected vs Actual, Environment

### Commit Templates

```bash
git add .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
git commit -m "chore: Add BMAD issue templates"
git push
```

### How Templates Help

**For BMAD agents:**

- PM agent creates issues programmatically (doesn't use templates)
- Templates are for **manual issue creation** by team members

**For your team:**

- Click "New Issue" on GitHub → see template options
- Templates ensure consistent formatting
- Reduces back-and-forth on missing information

**Note:** Templates are optional. The BMAD agents work fine without them since they create well-formatted issues automatically.

## 💡 BMAD-Core-GitHub Framework Knowledge

I can answer any questions about using bmad-core-github! Here's what I know:

### Agent Questions

**"How do I switch between agents?"**

Just tell Claude to act as a different agent:

```
"Please switch to the PM agent from .bmad-core-github/expansion-packs/bmad-core-github/agents/pm.md"
```

**"Which agent should I use for what?"**

- **Analyst (Emma)** - Project inception, requirements discovery, brainstorming
- **PM (John)** - PRD creation, epic/story management, backlog prioritization
- **Architect (Sarah)** - Architecture design, tech stack, dependencies, ADRs
- **Dev (James)** - Implementing stories, writing code, creating PRs
- **QA (Maria)** - Code review, testing, quality gates
- **SM (Bob)** - Sprint planning, backlog management, velocity tracking
- **PO (Lisa)** - Stakeholder management, prioritization, ROI analysis
- **Dev Team Lead** - Parallel orchestration, wave-based execution
- **UX Expert (Rachel)** - UI specifications, wireframes, usability
- **Setup Assistant (Me!)** - Setup, configuration, and answering questions

**"Can agents work together?"**

Yes! Agents pass context through:

- **Documents** - PM creates PRD, Dev reads it to implement
- **GitHub Issues** - PM creates issues, Dev picks them up, QA reviews
- **GitHub Labels** - Status transitions show what stage each task is in
- **Dependencies** - Architect adds dependencies, SM enforces them

### Workflow Questions

**"What's the complete workflow from idea to deployment?"**

1. **Ideation** (Analyst)
   - Run `*create-project-brief`
   - Creates `docs/notes/project-brief.md`

2. **Planning** (PM)
   - Run `*create-prd`
   - Creates `docs/prd/project-prd.md`
   - Creates GitHub Milestones (epics)
   - Creates GitHub Issues (stories)

3. **Architecture** (Architect)
   - Run `*design-architecture`
   - Creates `docs/architecture/` files
   - Adds dependencies to issues

4. **Sprint Planning** (SM)
   - Run `*sprint-planning`
   - Moves stories from backlog → todo
   - Creates sprint milestone

5. **Development** (Dev)
   - Run `*next-task`
   - Updates issue status → doing
   - Implements code
   - Creates PR linking to issue

6. **Review** (QA)
   - Automated QA reviews PR
   - Or manual: `*review-pr`
   - Updates issue status → review
   - Approves or requests changes

7. **Merge & Deploy**
   - Merge PR
   - Issue automatically closed
   - Status automatically → done

**"How do status labels work?"**

Status labels track the workflow stage:

- `status:backlog` - Not yet scheduled
- `status:todo` - Ready to start (sprint planning moved it here)
- `status:doing` - Developer is working on it
- `status:review` - PR is open, QA is reviewing
- `status:done` - PR merged, issue closed

**"What happens in the QA review loop?"**

1. Dev creates PR → issue status changes to `review`
2. QA reviews (automated or manual)
3. If PASS → approve and merge → status to `done`
4. If FAIL_MINOR → status back to `doing` (quick fix)
5. If FAIL_MAJOR → status back to `todo` (needs rework)

### GitHub Integration Questions

**"How do epics and milestones work?"**

- **Epics** = GitHub Milestones
- **Stories** = GitHub Issues assigned to a milestone
- PM creates both from the PRD
- Track progress: Milestone shows X of Y issues complete

**"What are the label categories?"**

1. **Status** (workflow stage): backlog, todo, doing, review, done
2. **Type** (task type): epic, story, task, bug
3. **Priority** (urgency): p0 (critical), p1 (high), p2 (medium), p3 (low)
4. **Size** (estimate): xs (<1hr), s (1-4hrs), m (1day), l (2-3days), xl (>3days)

**"How do I create an issue manually?"**

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "Story: User can login" \
  --body "As a user, I want to login..." \
  --label "type:story,status:backlog,priority:p1,size:m" \
  --milestone "Epic: Authentication"
```

But usually the PM agent creates them for you!

**"How do dependencies work?"**

Add to issue body:

```
## Dependencies
- Depends on #123
- Depends on #456
```

Architect adds these, SM checks them during sprint planning.

**"How do I track sprint progress?"**

```bash
# See all doing issues
gh issue list --label "status:doing"

# See all review issues
gh issue list --label "status:review"

# See sprint milestone progress
gh issue list --milestone "Sprint 1"
```

Or ask SM agent: `*sprint-status`

### Automated QA Questions

**"How does automated QA work?"**

1. Dev creates PR
2. GitHub Actions triggers `automated-qa-review.yml`
3. QA agent (Claude Sonnet 4) analyzes code
4. Posts review verdict (PASS/FAIL_MINOR/FAIL_MAJOR)
5. Updates issue status automatically

**"Can I customize QA thresholds?"**

Yes! Edit `.bmad-core-github/expansion-packs/bmad-core-github/config.yaml`:

```yaml
qa:
  automated_review:
    thresholds:
      min_test_coverage: 80 # Change this
      max_code_smells: 5 # Change this
      max_complexity: 15 # Change this
```

**"What if automated QA fails but I want to merge anyway?"**

You can override:

1. Comment on PR: `/qa override <reason>`
2. Or manually approve the PR in GitHub
3. Or adjust thresholds in config

### Parallel Execution Questions

**"What is wave-based parallel execution?"**

Dev Team Lead orchestrates multiple devs working simultaneously:

- **Wave 1**: Tasks with no dependencies (parallel)
- **Wave 2**: Tasks that depend on Wave 1 (parallel within wave)
- **Wave 3**: Tasks that depend on Wave 2 (parallel within wave)

3-5x faster than sequential!

**"How do I use parallel execution?"**

```bash
# Switch to Dev Team Lead
"Please act as Dev Team Lead from .bmad-core-github/expansion-packs/bmad-core-github/agents/dev-team-lead.md"

# Run parallel execution
"*execute-sprint"
```

Or use default in-context mode for full visibility.

### Document Questions

**"Where are documents stored?"**

- `docs/prd/` - Product Requirements Documents
- `docs/architecture/` - Architecture designs, tech stack, ADRs
- `docs/specs/` - Detailed specifications
- `docs/guides/` - User/developer guides
- `docs/notes/` - Project briefs, meeting notes

All stored as markdown files in Git (version controlled).

**"Do documents have metadata?"**

Yes! Frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: My Project PRD
version: 1.0
author: John (PM Agent)
date: 2025-10-20
status: draft
---
```

**"How do agents reference documents?"**

Agents automatically:

1. Check for prerequisite docs
2. Read them for context
3. Reference them in issues/PRs
4. Update them when needed

### Claude Code Integration Questions

**"How do I use @claude mentions?"**

After setting up `claude-code-integration.yml`:

```bash
# Comment on any issue:
@claude Please implement this story

# Comment on any PR:
@claude Review this code for security issues
```

**"Can I specify which agent to use?"**

Yes:

```
@claude Use the Dev agent to implement this feature
@claude Use the QA agent to review this PR
```

Or configure it in the workflow file.

**"Does it cost money?"**

Yes, uses your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:

- Simple queries: $0.01-0.05
- Code implementation: $0.10-0.50
- Large refactoring: $0.50-2.00

### Troubleshooting Questions

**"Agent says 'missing prerequisite documents'"**

The agent is checking workflow order:

- PM needs project brief from Analyst
- Architect needs PRD from PM
- Dev needs architecture from Architect

Either create the prerequisite or tell agent to proceed anyway.

**"GitHub CLI commands aren't working"**

Check:

```bash
gh auth status  # Must be authenticated
git remote -v   # Must have GitHub remote configured
```

**"Labels aren't being applied to issues"**

Run the setup script:

```bash
.bmad-core-github/expansion-packs/bmad-core-github/scripts/setup-labels.sh
```

**"Automated QA isn't running"**

Check:

1. ANTHROPIC_API_KEY secret: `gh secret list`
2. Workflow file exists: `.github/workflows/automated-qa-review.yml`
3. Actions enabled: Settings → Actions → General
4. Check Actions tab for errors

**"Issues not linking to PRs"**

Include in PR description:

```
Fixes #123
Closes #456
```

GitHub automatically links them.

### Best Practices Questions

**"Should I use automated or manual QA?"**

**Automated** (recommended):

- Faster (no waiting for QA agent)
- Consistent quality checks
- Costs ~$0.05 per PR
- Use for: Most PRs

**Manual**:

- More thorough
- Better for complex changes
- Free (uses your Claude context)
- Use for: Major refactors, security changes

**"How detailed should stories be?"**

PM agent creates detailed stories with:

- User story format (As a... I want... So that...)
- Acceptance criteria (specific, testable)
- Implementation tasks (subtasks list)
- Dependencies (what must be done first)

This gives Dev agent full context without questions.

**"How many stories in a sprint?"**

Start with velocity 0 (unknown), estimate:

- Small team (1-2 devs): 5-10 stories
- Medium team (3-5 devs): 10-20 stories
- Large team (6+ devs): 20-30 stories

SM tracks velocity and adjusts future sprints.

**"Should I create branches manually?"**

No! Dev agent creates feature branches automatically:

- `feature/story-title-123`
- Linked to issue #123
- Automatically pushed to origin

### Configuration Questions

**"How do I customize agent behavior?"**

Edit `.bmad-core-github/expansion-packs/bmad-core-github/config.yaml`:

```yaml
dev_team_lead:
  default_mode: 'in-context' # or "parallel"
  parallel:
    max_developers: 5 # Adjust team size

qa:
  automated_review:
    enabled: true # Toggle automated QA
    auto_merge_on_pass: false # Auto-merge on PASS?
```

**"Can I use different status labels?"**

Yes, but you'll need to:

1. Update `config.yaml` status_flow
2. Recreate labels with new names
3. Update agents to use new labels

Not recommended - better to use standard labels.

**"How do I integrate with Slack/Jira?"**

Edit `config.yaml`:

```yaml
integrations:
  slack:
    enabled: true
    webhook_url: https://hooks.slack.com/...
  jira:
    enabled: true
    sync_issues: true
```

## Quick Troubleshooting

**"gh: command not found"**
→ GitHub CLI not installed. Run `*setup-gh-cli` for installation instructions.

**"gh auth status" shows not logged in**
→ Run `gh auth login` and follow the prompts.

**Labels script fails with "permission denied"**
→ Make it executable: `chmod +x .bmad-core-github/expansion-packs/bmad-core-github/scripts/setup-labels.sh`

**Can't create GitHub issues**
→ Check authentication (`gh auth status`) and remote configuration (`git remote -v`)

**Automated QA not running**
→ Check that ANTHROPIC_API_KEY secret is set: `gh secret list`

**Still stuck?**
→ Run `*check-status` to see what's missing, then ask me for help with that specific step!

---

**💡 Pro Tip:** After setup is complete, run `*verify` to make sure everything is working, then switch to the Analyst agent with:

"Please switch to the Analyst agent from .bmad-core-github/expansion-packs/bmad-core-github/agents/analyst.md"

Then start your project with: `*create-project-brief`

Happy building! 🚀
